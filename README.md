chatbot:
'ml_model.ipynb' is a python notebook that creates and saves a machine learning model to 'chatbot_model.h5'.
It also creates other data structures that work with the model, which it saves to the 'pickles' folder.

'intents.json' is the json file containing the input data that the model was trained on and where the model gets its outputs from.
I didn't create this file but intend on creating my own one down the line.

'test_the_model.py' can be ran to test the model

cozmo:
Make Cozmo do stuff. Haven't figured out what yet. Can so far adjust it position so that the user's face is in the centre of its camera feed, and can say things using speech synthesis.

gui:
to come
